### ⚙️ The Engineering Mindset
My journey began with a fascination for how things work. [cite_start]As a **Mechanical Engineering student**, I was trained to look at the world through the lens of Calculus and Physics—breaking down massive, complex machines into their smallest moving parts. 

### 💡 The Pivot to Data
I soon realized that a business is just another type of complex machine, and **Data is its fuel**. [cite_start]I pursued the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** to master the tools—SQL, R, Spreadsheet and Tableau—that allow me to "diagnose" business health just as an engineer diagnoses a mechanical system.

### 🌟 Early-Age Career Pursuit
[cite_start]From resolving 50+ technical inquiries daily in customer service to managing 1.9M+ rows of data before finishing my first year of university, I have always been driven by **rigor and reliability**. [cite_start]My early career has been defined by "Analytical Empathy"—the ability to listen to human problems and solve them with mathematical precision[cite: 1, 2].

### ⚡ Remote Readiness
[cite_start]I operate a high-uptime home office in Nigeria with **24/7 solar power backup** and **fiber-optic internet**, ensuring I am always synced with teams in **EST, CET, or GMT**.
